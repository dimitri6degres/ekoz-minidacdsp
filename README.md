I wanted a dac with a "night mode" preset.  
Movies' soundtrack are awfull : we don't anderstand dialogs, but fx are very loud…  
it's impossible to watch a movie without playing permanently with the remote !

i've got a good stereo system (don't want HC 5.1…)  
i'm watching movies on a projector with an appleTV.  
So what i need is a small DAC with an optical input and stereo RCA output.  
After some googling, i don't see anything that can resolve my problem.  
The only way i've found was the Hifiberry DAC+ DSP

so let's go…
